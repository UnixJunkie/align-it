INTRODUCTION AND REQUIREMENTS

The following tools are required to compile Align-it:

	- The latest version of the OpenBabel source code (at least version 2.3)
	- A C++ compiler (like g++) 
	- A makefile system (like GNU make) 
	- CMake system (www.cmake.org)

If you want to install globally on your system, you will need root access, and should follow these instructions.


INSTALL GLOBALLY (YOU NEED ROOT ACCESS)

(1) Open a command window, and decompress the downloaded file with following command:

> tar -xvf align-it-1.0.4.tar.gz

This will create a folder called 'align-it-1.0.4'. 

(2) You now need to configure and compile Align-it. Run the following commands, one after the other:

> cd align-it-1.0.4
> cmake CMakeLists.txt
> make

(3) If you have root permissions, you can install Align-it globally. As root, run the following command:

> make install
> make clean
